How do I prepare 1M NaCl solution?,To prepare 1L of 1 M NaCl solution: Calculate moles = 1 mol/L × 1 L = 1 mol. Molar mass of NaCl ≈ 58.44 g/mol. Weigh 58.44 g NaCl, transfer to a volumetric flask, dissolve in some distilled water, and make up the volume to 1 L.,Solutions
How do I prepare 0.1M HCl from concentrated HCl?,Assume concentrated HCl is 12 M. Use C1V1 = C2V2. For 1 L of 0.1 M HCl: V1 = (0.1 × 1000 mL) / 12 ≈ 8.3 mL. Carefully pipette 8.3 mL conc. HCl into ~800 mL water with stirring (always add acid to water), then dilute to 1 L.,Solutions
What is the principle of acid base titration?,In an acid-base titration, a solution of known concentration (titrant) is added to a solution of unknown concentration (analyte) until the reaction reaches the equivalence point. An indicator or a pH meter is used to detect this point, allowing calculation of the unknown concentration.,Titration
How do I calculate moles from mass?,Use the relationship: moles = mass (g) / molar mass (g/mol). For example, 10 g NaCl with molar mass 58.44 g/mol corresponds to 10 / 58.44 ≈ 0.171 mol.,Stoichiometry
What is the ideal gas law?,The ideal gas law is PV = nRT, where P is pressure, V is volume, n is moles of gas, R is the gas constant, and T is temperature in Kelvin.,Physical Chemistry
What are safety precautions when handling concentrated acids?,Wear lab coat, safety goggles, and acid-resistant gloves. Work in a well-ventilated area or fume hood. Always add acid to water, never water to acid. In case of skin contact, rinse with plenty of water and seek medical attention if needed.,Safety
How do I convert between Celsius and Kelvin?,To convert °C to K, use K = °C + 273.15. For example, 25°C = 298.15 K.,Basic Concepts
What is a buffer solution?,A buffer solution resists changes in pH when small amounts of acid or base are added. It typically consists of a weak acid and its conjugate base or a weak base and its conjugate acid.,Solutions
